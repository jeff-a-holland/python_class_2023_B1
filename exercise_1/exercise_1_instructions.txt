I want you to create two different functions, collect_places and display_places.  Neither function takes an argument;
instead, they will both work with a global variable, "visits".  (I'm purposely keeping quiet about my preferred type
for "visits", so that you can think about it a bit.)

The idea is that we want to organize a list of places to which someone has traveled. That is: We'll ask the user to
enter, one at a time, a city and country to which they have traveled. The city and country should be separated by a
comma. If there is no comma, then the user is given an error message, and given another chance. If the user enters a
city-country combination, then this information is recorded, and then they're asked again.  Indeed, the user is asked
again and again for a city-country combination, until they provide an empty response. When that happens, the questioning
phase ends, and the reporting phase begins.

In the report, we'll want to see a list of all of the places visited, organized by country. That is, we'll get a list of
the visited countries, presented in alphabetical order, and for each country, we'll see a list of visited cities, also
in alphabetical order.  If the city was visited more than once, then we'll see a number next to its name.

For example, this is how the interaction could look:
    Tell me where you went: New York, USA
    Tell me where you went: London, England
    Tell me where you went: Shanghai, China
    Tell me where you went: Chicago, USA
    Tell me where you went: Beijing, China
    Tell me where you went: Chicago, USA
    Tell me where you went: Beijing, China
    Tell me where you went: lalala
    That's not a legal city, country combination
    Tell me where you went: Boston, USA
    Tell me where you went: <user presses "enter" here>

    You visited:
    China
        Beijing (2)
        Shanghai
    England
        London
    USA
        Boston
        Chicago (2)
        New York
